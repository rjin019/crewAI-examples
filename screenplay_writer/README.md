# AI Crew for screenwriting
## Introduction
Example script to automatically write a screenplay from a newsgroup post using agents with [Crew.ai] (https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) .
CrewAI orchestrates autonomous AI agents, enabling them to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.
You can also try it out with a personal email with many replies back and forth and see it turn into a movie script.
Demonstrates:
- multiple API endpoints (offical Mistral, Together.ai, Anyscale)
- running single tasks: spam detection and scoring
- running a crew to create a screenplay from a newsgroup post by first analyzing the text, creating a dialogue and ultimately formatting it
